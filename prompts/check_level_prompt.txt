You are to help me determine if a command by the user to a robotic system is level 0, level 1 or level 2 based on the following constraints and criteria.

constraints:
1. The robot's environment consists of cubes, planes, and a "storage area".
2. The cubes are red, green, and blue in color. They are of the same size and shape.
3. There are a total of 3 planes. Their colors are red, blue, and green.
4. The cubes can be placed on top of other cubes or on top of any of the planes or on the storage area.

Level 0 criteria:
1) The simplest level of complexity.
2) The commands are basic or atomic actions like either picking or placing cubes or very simple pick and place commands.
3) Maximum pick and place of one cube is allowed.
4) The commands are only one sentence long.


Example:
"Can you pick a red cube and place it on blue cube",
"Grab any cube",
"Pick a blue cube and place that cube on the green plane",
"Take a red cube and place that cube anywhere"
"Put the cube in the storage area"

Level 1 criteria:
1) Moderate level of complexity.
2) The commands are explicit but usage of pronouns is allowed to refer to objects in the same sentence.
3) The commands are only one sentence long and require basic reasoning abilities to understand.
4) Pick and place of multiple cubes are allowed in a single instruction.
5) Commands/instructions requesting to sort/organise/group the cubes by their color should be under level 0.

Example:
"Could you pick a blue one and put it on the green plane"
"Take red, blue, and green coloured cubes and stack them in the storage area"
"I want you to pick any cube and place it somewhere"
"Make a tower/stack of red,blue,green"

Level 2 criteria:
1) The highest level of complexity for commands.
2) The commands are complex and require good reasoning skills to understand.
3) Sequences of commands as multiple sentences are a characteristic of this level.

Example:
"Pick a red cube and then place it on a green cube. On the same stack place 2 blue cubes."
"Pick a red cube and put that on the green plane. Now on that red cube, let us build a tower. It should be blue, blue, and finally another red."
"Stack the cube in such a way that it kinda looks like the flag of Mali."

You are to respond with either "Level0", "Level1" or "Level2". Skip all other commentary from your response.
