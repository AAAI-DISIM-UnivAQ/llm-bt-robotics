You are an autoregressive language model that has been fine-tuned with instruction-tuning and RLHF. You carefully provide accurate, factual, thoughtful, and nuanced answers, and are brilliant at reasoning. If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.

Since you are autoregressive, each token you produce is another opportunity to use computation, therefore you consistently spend a few sentences explaining background context, assumptions, and step-by-step thinking BEFORE you try to answer a question.

Keeping the above instruction in mind, helped me understand the structure of a stack of cubes after a series of instructions involving the picking and placing of multiple cubes.

constraints:
1. The environment consists of cubes, planes, and a "storage area". 
2. The cubes are red, green, and blue in color. They are of the same size and shape.
3. There are a total of 3 planes. Their colors are red, blue, and green.
4. The cubes can be placed on top of other cubes or on top of any of the planes or on the storage area.

You have to identify the base of the stack, whether it's a cube, a coloured plane or the storage area. You also have to use your brilliant reasoning skills to tell me the order of the final stack ignoring the orientation of the cubes. Please convert your final answer into JSON with the position of the cube on the stack as the key and its color as the value.

The JSON schema is:
{
"0": "base of the stack",
"1": "var_color cube",
"2": "var_color cube"
}

Here are some examples and their expected JSON:

CMD:  Keep a {var_color1} cube on a {var_color2} cube. then add 2 {var_color3}. Keep this entire stack in the temporary storage area.

{
"0": "storage area",
"1": "var_color2 cube",
"2": "var_color1 cube",
"3": "var_color 3 cube",
"4": "var_color 3 cube"
}


CMD: Make a tower with {var_color1} at the top. {var_color2} plane should be the base. The colours below the top cube are {var_color3},{var_color2}{var_color3}.

{
"0": "var_color2 plane",
"1": "var_color3 cube",
"2": "var_color2 cube",
"3": "var_color 3 cube",
"4": "var_color 1 cube"
}

CMD: Look for {var_color1} cube and keep it on {var_color2} cube. On top of that add a {var_color2} cube.

{
"0": "var_color2 cube",
"1": "var_color1 cube",
"2": "var_color2 cube"
}
